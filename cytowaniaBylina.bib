It is vital that the technology be adaptable, so that the right information is available to the right doctors. We investigate the use of smartphones and various user stereotypes functioning in a hospital environment, as these stereotypes can play an important role in designing and adapting the mobile user interface (MUI) for health care applications. This paper discusses how a user stereotype can be modeled and used for adapting \{MUI\} for health care applications in a hospital setting. An empirical study using questionnaires and interviews among 30 doctors is conducted in order to extract the characteristics of each user stereotype, in terms of age group, domain experience, and mobile technology use. The study confirms that there are three groups of doctors in hospitals: junior, intermediate, and experienced, corresponding to the hierarchical structure in place in the hospital setting. A set of context descriptor sentences is extracted from each group during the interview, in order to consider the context of use of smartphones in adapting the \{MUI\} for these applications. },

We investigate the use of smart phones in the hospital environment, as they can play an important role in the recording and exchanging of information. This paper examines how context can be characterised for developing context sensitive user interfaces for smart phone application in a hospital environment. We introduce a new characterisation of the notion of context, based on the principle of separation of the concerns that are relevant to the application domain. We coin the term context descriptor, which captures the notion of context at the end-user level, while the characterisation of the context incorporates the user model via the user stereotype. We use a sub-domain of health care, nursing services, the tasks of the nurses serving as a living example to illustrate the ideas presented. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Mobile health (mHealth) analytical technologies are potentially useful for carrying out modern medical diagnostics in resource-poor settings. Effective mHealth devices for underserved populations need to be simple, low cost, and portable. Although cell phone cameras have been used for biodetection, their sensitivity is a limiting factor because currently it is too low to be effective for many mHealth applications, which depend on detection of weak fluorescent signals. To improve the sensitivity of portable phones, a capillary tube array was developed to amplify fluorescence signals using their waveguide properties. An array configured with 36 capillary tubes was demonstrated to have a â??100?? increase in sensitivity, lowering the limit of detection (LOD) of mobile phones from 1000&#xa0;nM to 10&#xa0;nM for fluorescein. To confirm that the amplification was due to waveguide behavior, we coated the external surfaces of the capillaries with silver. The silver coating interfered with the waveguide behavior and diminished the fluorescence signal, thereby proving that the waveguide behavior was the main mechanism for enhancing optical sensitivity. The optical configuration described here is novel in several ways. First, the use of capillaries waveguide properties to improve detection of weak florescence signal is new. Second we describe here a three dimensional illumination system, while conventional angular laser waveguide illumination is spot (or line), which is functionally one-dimensional illumination, can illuminate only a single capillary or a single column (when a line generator is used) of capillaries and thus inherently limits the multiplexing capability of detection. The planar illumination demonstrated in this work enables illumination of a two dimensional capillary array (e.g., x columns and y rows of capillaries). In addition, the waveguide light propagation via the capillary wall provides a third dimension for illumination along the axis of the capillaries. Such an array can potentially be used for sensitive analysis of multiple fluorescent detection assays simultaneously. The simple phone based capillary array approach presented in this paper is capable of amplifying weak fluorescent signals thereby improving the sensitivity of optical detectors based on mobile phones. This may allow sensitive biological assays to be measured with low sensitivity detectors and may make mHealth practical for many diagnostics applications, especially in resource-poor and global health settings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Population in modern societies is ageing, and the number of elders in complete isolation increases with this phenomena. Information technologies are being increasingly used to enhance remote communications and monitoring between elders and caregivers. However, these technologies seldom are adapted to eldersâ?? real needs and functional limitations, and are often discarded by them. They are usually hard to use and lack a set of features that elders perceive as useful to their daily- life communications with their caregivers. In this paper we present Protege: an Android mobile application for the elder- caregiver paradigm, with a fully customized user interface. The integrated features of Protege and its fully customized user interfaces allow for an efficient way of enhancing elder-caregiver communications, and provides elders with a safety- critical device that they can easily use to call for help. },

  Abstract                 = {Windows based mobile application for m-health and environmental monitoring sensor devices were developed and tested. With the number of smartphone users exponentially increasing, the applications developed for m-health and environmental monitoring devices are easy to reach the general public, if the applications are simple, user-friendly and personalized. The sensing device uses Bluetooth to communicate with the smartphone, providing mobility to the user. Since the device is small and hand-held, the user can put his smartphone in his pocket, connected to the device in his hand and can move anywhere with it. The data processing performed in the applications is verified against standard off the shelf software, the results of the tests are discussed in this document. The user-interface is very simple and doesn't require many inputs from the user other than during the initial setting when they have to enter their personal information for the records. The m-health application can be used by doctors as well as by patients. The response of the application is very quick and hence the patients need not wait for a long time to see the results. The environmental monitoring device has a real-time plot displayed on the screen of the smartphone showing concentrations of total volatile organic compounds and airborne particle count in the environment at the location of the device. The programming was done with Microsoft Visual Studio and was written on VB.NET platform. On the applications, the smartphone receives data as raw binary bytes from the device via Bluetooth and this data is processed to obtain the final result. The final result is the concentration of Nitric Oxide in ppb in the Asthma Analyzer device. In the environmental monitoring device, the final result is the concentration of total Volatile Organic Compounds and the count of airborne Particles.},

Such systems will consist of various devices, ranging from resource-constrained sensors and actuators to complex multimedia devices, supporting time critical applications. This is further compounded by cultural and socio-economical factors that must be addressed for next generation healthcare systems to be widely diffused and used. In this study, the requirements for a vital sign monitoring solution space is derived and mPHASiS is developed based on these requirements. mPHASiS is an end to end solution not only providing sensor networking and vital sign monitoring but also closing the loop by signaling alert messages to the caregiver and allowing pervasive access to vital signs of a patient using smartphones over a heterogeneous network. A role based access control mechanism is developed to limit access to sensitive data. The end to end delay and delay variations for both vital sign data collection and pervasive access are analyzed. mPHASiS is developed as a complementary solution augmenting functionality of a hospital information system and can be loosely couple with the hospital information system using webservices. },

  Abstract                 = {Achieving and sustaining good blood pressure control continues to be a challenge for many reasons including nonadherence with prescribed treatment and lifestyle measures, shortage of primary care physicians especially in less populated areas, and variations in physiciansâ?? practice behaviour. Many strategies have been advocated to improve outcomes with the greatest success being achieved using nurse or pharmacist-led interventions in which they were given the authority to prescribe or alter antihypertensive treatment. However, this treatment approach, which historically involved 1-on-1 visits to a doctorâ??s office or pharmacy, proved costly, was not scalable, and did not actively engage patients in treatment decision-making. Several electronic health interventions have been designed to overcome these limitations. Though more patient-centred and often effective, they required wired connections and a personal computer, and logging on for Internet access and navigating computer screens greatly reduced access for many older patients. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the benefits were related to better case management or technological advances. Mobile health (mHealth) technology circumvents the technical challenges of electronic health systems and provides a more flexible platform to enhance patient self-care. mHealth applications are particularly appropriate for interventions that depend on patients' sustained adherence to monitoring schedules and prescribed treatments. Studies from our group in hypertension and other chronic conditions have shown improved health outcomes using mHealth applications that have undergone rigourous usability testing. Nonetheless, the inability of most electronic medical record systems to receive and process information from mobile devices continues to be a major impediment in realizing the full potential of mHealth technology. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract According to predictions of information technology research and advisory firms, such as Gartner, hybrid \{HTML5\} appli- cations will be the future for mobile application development. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using \{HTML5\} and related web application standards for the development of mobile e-health applications, using a diabetes monitoring application as a practical use case. Context-awareness and visualizing multivariate data with parallel coordinates for decision support are key features of this mobile e-health application. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of the hybrid \{HTML5\} approach with native mobile applications, and report on practical experiences with the development and usage of the application. Our experiments show that developers of fairly advanced context-aware mobile applications can definitely benefit from the \{HTML5\} application portability across different mobile platforms. However, compared to native applications, they should be aware of missing features such as secure storage, non-negligible performance penalties of JavaScript business logic on a mobile platform, and an inferior user experience. },

  Abstract                 = {Objective Self-management of risk behaviors is a cornerstone of future population health interventions. Using mobile phones for routine self-monitoring and feedback is a cost-efficient strategy for self-management and ecological momentary interventions (EMI). However, mobile health applications need to be designed to be highly attractive and acceptable to a broad range of user groups. To inform the design of an adaptable mobile health application we aimed to identify the dimensions and range of user preferences for application features by different user groups. Methods Five focus group interviews were conducted: two (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;9; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20) with people living with \{HIV\} (PLH) and three with young mothers (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8; n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group sessionsâ?? notes and transcripts. Results Both groups considered customization of reminders and prompts as necessary, and goal setting, motivational messaging, problem solving, and feedback as attractive. For PLH, automated and location-based reminders for medication adherence and sharing data with healthcare providers were both acceptable and attractive features. Privacy protection and invasiveness were the primary concerns, particularly around location tracking, illegal drug use, and sexual partner information. Concerns were ameliorated by use scenario or purpose, monetary incentives, and password protection. Privacy was not a major concern to mothers who considered passwords burdensome. Mothersâ?? preferences focused on customization that supports mood, exercise and eating patterns, and especially using the mobile phone camera to photograph food to increase self-accountability. Conclusions Individualization emerged as the key feature and design principle to reduce user burden and increase attractiveness and acceptability. Mobile phone \{EMI\} uniquely enables individualization, context-aware and real-time feedback, and tailored intervention delivery. },

Mobile information communication technologies can help implement ulcer care protocols and the monitoring of patients with high risk, thus preventing or improving these conditions. This article presents a mobile pressure ulcer monitoring platform (mULCER), which helps control a patientâ??s ulcer status during all stages of treatment. Beside its stand-alone version, it can be integrated with electronic health record systems as mULCER synchronizes ulcer data with any electronic health record system using HL7 standards. It serves as a tool to integrate nursing care among hospital departments and institutions. mULCER was experimented with in different mobile devices such as LG Optimus One P500, Samsung Galaxy Tab, HTC Magic, Samsung Galaxy S, and Samsung Galaxy i5700, taking into account the userâ??s experience of different screen sizes and processing characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Health informatics is the multidisciplinary field of study that uses computing and information technology (IT) to collect, store, interpret, and deliver health information to doctors, patients, and consumers. Health informatics applications have historically been limited by the computing and IT capabilities of the time, whether it be equipment cost, size, processing abilities or general availability. However, in the past two decades, personal computers and peripheral equipment overcame these hurdles enabling an abundant amount of Electronic Healthcare (eHealth) applications, such as patient/doctor communication via telecommunication, electronic health record management, emergency information delivery, and medical data transmission. Furthermore, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming a dominant computing source in the consumer market with over 1 billion smartphone and tablet sales in 2013 alone. Because of their prevalence, inexpensive costs, processing power, and small form factor, mobile devices are also becoming primary computing devices in Health Informatics, satisfying Mobile Healthcare (mHealth) applications. This thesis discusses 4 mHealth applications and the corresponding tablet-apps developed to handle the health information. Specifically, each tablet-app has a particular focus in either the collection, interpretation, or delivery of health information. The applications of the 4 mHealth apps are: surveying youth in Swaziland, Africa to research the connections between relationship-oriented, psychological development and impoverished environments, pain classification for pain treatment of veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D), pressure ulcer prevention training for occupational therapists working with veterans with SCI/D, and self-health reporting and information delivery for senior citizens prescribed to anticoagulant medications. These apps aim to yield more extensive surveys and research studies, more standard diagnosis suggestions, less prevalence of pressure ulcers, and healthier senior citizens.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Mobile health has been receiving a lot of attention from patients, healthcare professionals, application developers, network service providers and researchers. Mobile health is more than just some healthcare applications on a mobile phone and it can involve sensors and wireless networks in monitoring various conditions, mobile devices to access numerous healthcare services, healthcare professionals to make decisions and provide emergency care, and for the elderly to manage their daily activities in independent living. More specifically, m-health can result in major advances in (a) expanding healthcare coverage, (b) improving decision making, (c) managing chronic conditions and (d) providing suitable healthcare in emergencies. To help realize these advances, there are major research challenges that need to be addressed. We classify these challenges in four categories of (a) patients related, (b) healthcare professionals related, (c) \{IT\} related and (d) applications related challenges. Within each category, we identify several research problems, and we present some high-level and preliminary solutions along with an agenda for future research. The paper may provide a platform for future research and decision-making related to patients, healthcare professionals, applications, and infrastructure. These decisions will significantly impact how future mobile health services will be designed, developed, evaluated, and adopted globally. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The rapid and wide-scale introduction of mobile technologies in healthcare is resulting in an emerging area of mobile health. m-Health has major implications for patients, healthcare professionals, developers, infrastructure providers and regulators in both developed and developing countries. Mobile technologies can not only support instant and ubiquitous access to information, healthcare professionals and patients, but can also create many interesting challenges, including additional complexity and potential for various errors. In this paper, we address how mobile health can be more effectively supported by mobile technologies. More specifically, we present two sets of enhancements: (a) context-awareness and processing and (b) improved presentation of information to healthcare professionals. These enhancements are then applied in the conceptual design of a mobile health alert generation and processing system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements, we develop and utilize an analytical model. Using multiple metrics, including the number of alerts generated and probability of error in alert-response, we show that the proposed enhancements can improve the quality of mobile health. We hope that other researchers design, implement and evaluate additional enhancements in mobile technologies for m-health. While we do not present any prototypes of the systems, the work presented in the paper can lead to prototypes and testing of systems in the future for mobile health. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a detailed architecture and a token-based protocol for the trust delegation on medical data across a public mobile network. The trust is negotiated between a mobile emergency medical unit and a medical record database. The solution presented in this paper enables the development of a software tool that can be used by the emergency medical units in urgent need of sensitive personal medical records about unconscious patients. The trust delegated medical records are downloaded onto the handheld mobile devices of the mobile emergency medical personal. The downloaded medical records are used during emergency care and this data should be protected from future unauthorized distribution and misuse. This paper presents architecture of a mobile security capsule, which enables the trust negotiation to provide a highly secure environment which can be used for the access of highly confidential medical data over the mobile network. },
